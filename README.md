# Camera Target and Filters

This repository contains code for camera target tracking and various image filtering techniques using OpenCV. It demonstrates how to use predefined OpenCV modules and implement custom filters using mathematical functions.

## Overview

This project explores computer vision techniques for camera target tracking and image filtering. It includes implementations of common image filters using OpenCV's built-in functions and examples of creating custom filters using mathematical operations. The camera target tracking component aims to track a specific object or feature in a video stream.

## Features

* **Camera Target Tracking:**  Tracks a designated target (object or feature) in a video stream. *(Specify the tracking method used, e.g., color-based tracking, object detection, template matching, or any other relevant method.)*
* **Predefined OpenCV Filters:** Demonstrates the use of various predefined OpenCV filters (e.g., blurring, sharpening, edge detection, morphological operations).  *(List the specific filters implemented, e.g., Gaussian Blur, Median Blur, Sobel, Canny, Erosion, Dilation.)*
* **Custom Filters:** Implements custom image filters using mathematical functions. *(Describe the types of custom filters implemented and the mathematical operations involved.)*
* **[Other Features]:** List any other relevant features (e.g., video input, real-time processing, filter parameter adjustments).

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **OpenCV (cv2):** For image processing, video processing, and computer vision tasks.
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Bash

pip install numpy
[Other Libraries]: List any other Python libraries used.

(Explain any command-line arguments or configuration options. For example, you might have arguments to specify the video source, target color, or filter parameters.)
Camera Target Tracking
(Explain the camera target tracking method used in detail.  For example:)

Color-based Tracking: Explain how color is used to track the target. What color space is used (HSV, RGB)? How is the color range defined?
Object Detection: If using object detection, which model is used? How is the target object identified?
Other Methods: Describe any other tracking methods used.
Image Filtering
(Describe the image filtering techniques implemented.  For each filter (predefined and custom), explain:)

Purpose: What is the filter designed to do?
Implementation: How is the filter implemented (OpenCV function or mathematical equations)?
Parameters: What are the key parameters of the filter and how do they affect the results?
